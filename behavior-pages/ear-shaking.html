        <p>
          This is when a rabbit’s shakes their head to make their ears flop
          around a little. There are three reasons rabbits might do this.
        </p>
        <div class="clear"></div>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <em>They are happy.</em> Sometimes this is a mini binky and your
            rabbit is twitching their head to show they are happy. If your
            rabbit is happily running around and exploring, that’s usually what
            a little shake of their ears means.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>They are swatting your hand away.</em> If you are reaching for
            your rabbit and trying to pet them, but they shake their ears as
            your hand gets close, they are probably trying to tell you they are
            not interested in being pet right now.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>They have itchy ears.</em> If your rabbit shakes their head a
            number of times and then starts scratching at their ears, it means
            the ears are itchy.
          </li>
