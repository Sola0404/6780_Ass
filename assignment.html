<h1><b> My assignment.html page for linking to assignment items described in Assignment and Report Specifications</b></h1>
<p><br></p>
<p>This page is the marking guide to your website that your tutor will use to find your elements.  Do not name this page anything other than assignment.html (all lower case) or else we may not be able to find and mark your assignment elements.<span>&nbsp; </span>How to use this page:</p>
<ul>
  <li>upload this assignment.html file in your website directory during part 2.3 of Lab 1</li>
  <li>later, link this page to your website's index.html page</li>
  <li>over time, link each assignment task listed below to its location in your website as soon as you have started it</li>
  <li>replace the "notes" paragraph with your notes or
delete if you have no notes - your notes will help us understand and
mark your site so you should explain things. Maybe you did a task
differently from the way we specified it, either because your way is
better (tell us) or minimally or not at all to fit in with your site's
look and feel (tell us) or ... (also tell us). So, for example, a video
might spoil the look and feel. What you do is make one anyway, link to
it from this assessment.html page and explain in the <i>Notes</i> why
it's not linked to from your public version of your web site. You can
style this page as your like, so long as you keep the links to the
assignment tasks.</li>
  <li>provide details for your best student forums posts where indicated</li>
  <li>provide the date you attended the continuous improvement session where indicated</li>
  <li>provide link to report where indicated</li>
  <li>delete these instructions when you are ready</li>
</ul>

<h1><b>2.0 Part 2 Tasks</b></h1>
<h2><b>2.1 Image Map</b></h2>
<p><a href="index.html#behavior">This is my image map for bunnies behavior.</a></p>
<p>I use the whole image as the map.</p>
<p>When users mouse over different areas of the image, corresponding behavior tags would appear in the center. (Use JavaScript)</p>
<p>When users click on different areas, the page would be turned to corresponding page.</p>
<h2><b>2.2 Photo Gallery</b></h2>
<p><a href="index.html#pros">This is my gallery for Pros of petting bunnies.</a></p>
<p><a href="index.html#breeds">This is my gallery for breeds in Australia.</a></p>
<p>I find photo gallery is a pretty awesome method to organize a bunch of images, thus I added two of them in my web.</p>
<p>For breeds section, users can see the title when mouse over different photos.</p>
<p>For pros section, I use carousel in Bootstrap to make the slider effect, users could see title and comment for every photo.</p>

<h2><b>2.3 &amp; 2.4 Storyboard + Video / Javascript</b></h2>
<p>I am doing storyboard</p>

<h2><b>2.3 Storyboard for Video / Javascript addition</b></h2>
<p><a href="story-board.html">This is my story board.</a></p>
<p>I draw by hand in my Ipad, finding a story board is very helpful to save my time when editting video.</p>

<h2><b>2.4 Video / Well written Javascript</b></h2>
<p><a href="index.html#playing">This is my video.</a></p>
<p>I try to make the video more likely to MY thing, so I record it by myself with my baby Teemo.</p>
<p>I add transitions among almost the whole video, very useful to make the video more fluently!</p>
<p>I divide the content into 5 parts, and add 5 titles for them in the video.</p>
<p>I upload it to Youtube, because I find it slowly rendered on Partch. </p>

<h2><b>2.5 Student Forum Participation</b></h2>
