    <h1>About my site</h1>

    <div class="card">
      <p>I have learned a lot in the process of making this website.</p>

          <strong>1. Drawing a scratch before coding</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the significant things I learned is that we should draw a
          scratch about the design before we start coding.
        </p>
        <p>
          We could draw a tree to present the structure of the web pages, and
          for every node of the tree, we could use Figma to simply draw down the
          design of every page. We also could write the whole structure as an
          HTML tree, using HTML tags.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this assignment, I did not draw the scratch before coding, which
          causes a lot of wasted time when I decided on which kind of element I
          would use in which part. I think if I can make well design before
          coding next time, my website would be well structured, and the process
          of building the website would be more efficient.

          <strong>2. Choose the style as soon as possible</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          I find it very important to decide on which style the website should
          be as soon as possible. Should the website be fashionable, cute, or
          simple? The color palette, font style, and even layout depend on the
          style we choose. For example, if you decide to make a cute website
          about children, the dark background would look weird, while if your
          website is about cyberpunk, then it would be perfect.
        </p>
        <p>
          My website’s topic is bunnies, so I chose pink as the main color at
          first. But later, I found a pink website that looked not good, so I
          changed the color to yellow. I changed a lot of things including the
          background color in different sections, the font color, and the color
          of the navigation bar, which was very time-consuming. So I think we
          should make the proper decisions about what style the website should
          be as soon as possible.

        <p><strong>3. Provide convenient navigating methods</strong></p>
        <p>
          My website is mostly like a single-paged one in that all the main
          contents were shown on the homepage. As a result, the page became
          longer and longer as I added new content so that users should scroll
          down for a long time to look through the content. As Sabrina mentioned
          in the lecture, users would not have much patience to completely look
          through one website, so it is very important to design a convenient
          way for them to navigate to what they are looking for.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later, I used 2 methods to prevent this disadvantage of single-paged
          websites. First, I divided all content into several sections, and for
          every section, only some keywords were shown on the homepage. Every
          key word was clickable so that they could lead users to more detailed
          content. It made my homepage clear. Second, I added every section’s
          anchors in the navigation bar, in that users could quickly find what
          they want. If I could think about the user experience early, I would
          not waste much time deleting things from the homepage and
          restructuring them.

        <p><strong>4. Cascading CSS</strong></p>
        <p>
          At first, I created CSS files for each page, and write many redundant
          CSS rules in them. It was not only time-consuming but also very
          inconvenient when I wanted to change some common style for all the
          pages. Sometimes I forgot to edit some CSS files, which caused bugs
          that I had to check every CSS file to find them. But after I got to
          know the Cascading manner, I set one CSS file as the default CSS that
          was applied to all the pages, and other CSS files only included the
          specific style for each page. It was really useful to maintain my
          website.
